## Features

- **Customizable Questions**: All quiz questions are defined in a JavaScript file. You can easily modify the questions by updating the quiz data in the script.

- **Highest Score**: The highest score is saved in the browser's `localStorage` and shown to users after each quiz attempt.

3. You have **3 seconds** to answer each question before the timer runs out.
